// A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
// Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

function hero(bullets, dragons) {
  // Если у героя достаточно пуль для победы над всеми драконами,
  // возвращаем true, в противном случае возвращаем false
  return bullets >= dragons * 2;
